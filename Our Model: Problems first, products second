Our Model: Problems first, products second

We've got a crazy idea; that we can solve the world's problems by gathering the world's leading experts around a problem, then figuring out how to solve it, from the data up. 

Entrepearurs often seek an idea or a product they can develop. 'Hello World' is different. We start with a problem and try to solve it. 

We don't sell a specific product or service, but instead we seek commercial opportunities in a fluid nature throughout the process of solving a problem.

------------------------------------------------
The process:

We work on solving problems from a data driven ideology. We are obsessed by changing real world metrics that matter like 'parts per million' or 'kilograms per person', instead of being driven by conventional business metrics like 'clicks' or 'market share'. Using the process outlined in The Quest.

Data - Develop or enhance data collection systems around the problem as real-time as possible. Build a means to communicating the data to relevent parties. The first step in solving a problem is to understand it deeply. Also when people have access to numbers, they often change their behaviour. 
Skills #data, #hardware, #APIs, #servers, #programming, #sensing, #digital cities, #citizen science

Goals - Determine key metrics that measure the problem as solved
Skills #environmental science, #project evaluation

Visualisation - Illustrate the vision of what the world will be like when the problem is solved. The visualisation sells the vision to the stakeholders ands pulls together inspiration and allows leadership to flower.
Skills #Visionaries, #artists, #futurists, #imagination #leadership, #illustration, #copy writing, 

Idea Storming - When the data is investigated and the goal established, we brainstorm ideas to help solve the problem using the data as the primary compass.
Skills #creativity #innovation #sustainability, #environmental engineering, #design, #ideas, #mind mapping

Idea Assesment - Map all potentential ideas on a scale of ease to implement and effectiveness on the data. Chose ideas which are the most easy to implement with the highest effect on the data.
Skills #project assesment, #evaluation

Policy Design - 
Problems usually require government policy enacted in order to reach their full potential. We work out what polcies would be most effective at solving the problem and how to best have them brought into law.
Skills #legal, #advocacy, #politics, #campaigns

Behavioural Change - 
Isolate what behaviours need to be created or enhanced and implement game features to the process. We use the feedback from the data capturing to enhance the motivation design.
Skills #behaviour change, #motivation design, #communications, #gamification #player-agency, #social competition

Cults & tribes - Design a ideology and image around promoting a behaviour change. 
#advertising, #marketing, #branding, #social media

Technology - Develop any apps, games or tech solutions required to facilitate the idea. 
#computer science, #programming, #smart phone apps, #game design, #tech, #web apps, #data visualisation
