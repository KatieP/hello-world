                <p>We've got a crazy idea; that we can solve the world's problems by gathering the world's leading experts around a problem, then figuring out how to solve it, from the data up. </p>

                <p>Entrepeneaurs often seek an idea or a product they can develop. <em>Hello World</em> is different. We start with a problem and try to solve it, then seek commercial opportunities within the fabric of the problem solving process. </p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>The process</h2>
            <div id = "body-large">
                <p>We work on solving problems from a data driven ideology. We are obsessed by changing real world metrics that matter like 'parts per million' or 'kilograms per person', instead of being driven by conventional business metrics like 'clicks' or 'market share'. </p>

                <p>We approach problems using the process designed in <em><a href="">The Quest.</a></em> This means we start by understanding the data, make a goal, then brainstorm solutions using technology, gamification and cultural change mechanism. The data, or metrication of the problem is always king.</p>
