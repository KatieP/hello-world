                <p>We've got a crazy idea; that we can solve the world's problems by gathering the world's leading experts around a problem, then figuring out how to solve it, from the data up. </p>

                <p>Entrepeneaurs often seek an idea or a product they can develop. <em>Hello World</em> is different. We start with a problem and try to solve it, then seek commercial opportunities within the fabric of the problem solving process. </p>

            <h2>The process</h2>
            <div id = "body-large">
                <p>We work on solving problems from a data driven ideology. We are obsessed by changing real world metrics that matter like 'parts per million' or 'kilograms per person', instead of being driven by conventional business metrics like 'clicks' or 'market share'. </p>

                <p>We approach problems using the process designed in <em><a href="">The Quest.</a></em> This means we start by understanding the data, make a goal, then brainstorm solutions using technology, gamification and cultural change mechanism. The data, or metrication of the problem is always king.</p>

                        <p>The first step in solving a problem is to understand it deeply. We start every problem by capturing the data first.</p>

                        <p><em>"You can achieve amazing progress if you set a clear goal and find a measure that will drive progress toward that goal-in a feedback loop. This may seem pretty basic, but it is amazing to me how often it is not done and how hard it is to get right."</em> - Bill Gates</p>

                        <p>We work to develop or enhance data collection systems around the problem and allow the data to be communicated to the relevant parties as real-time as possible. Measurement is the first base of creating behaviour change. 

                        <p><em>"Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it."</em> - Paul Graham, YC</p>

                        <p>We create a goal from the most meaningful metric that most clearly indicates that the problem is 'solved'. </p>

                        <p>What will the world look like when this problem is solved? How will it work? What systems will it use?</p>  
                            
                        <p>The visualization method provides a fertile environment for imagination to grow. It unleashes brilliant constructive ideas for building news systems for the world we want. The completed visualisation becomes the flagship guiding star that sells the vision to all the people involved and positively inspires communities to take on the journey of change. </p>

                        <p>How do we get from here to there? Once the data is investigated and the metric goal established, we brainstorm ideas to help solve the problem using the data and visualisation as the primary compass.</P>

                        <p> This is where we unleash our imagination to brainstorm every idea we can think of to help solve the problem.</p>
